  <h1>Jon Goldsmith</h1>

  <p>I am a builder and founder, currently helping ambitious technical companies with problems involving labor and operational excellence. I was born and live in San Francisco. I like to work on systems that use technology to reconfigure scenes of humans.</p>

  <p>Previously I worked as the first software engineer at DoorDash while in high school. I later attended Philips Exeter, skipped MIT to start and sell an AI startup, and have worked on robotics, legal, and most recently food.</p>

  <p>I am interested in <a href="https://generativeanthropology.com/" target="_blank">generative anthropology</a> and its applications across political philosophy, machine consciousness, and religion.</p>
